# Team 6 -SFTP Pipeline

The goal of the Project is to build and develop a custom tool which will help streamline a data pipeline for one of our largest contracts. This will consist of building a backend to pull and manipulate data from databases; setting up connections and transfer processes between our servers and an SFTP portal; and developing a front-end / GUI with built-in feedback systems.
